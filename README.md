This project is a reflection of my journey in web development and showcases the skills, projects, and experiences I've gained along the way.
My portfolio embodies a clean and minimalistic design aesthetic, allowing visitors to focus on the content and projects without distraction.

I’ve leveraged HTML’s structure and semantics to create well-organized and accessible web pages that are easy to navigate and understand.
Continuously expand my skillset beyond HTML to include CSS, JavaScript, and other advanced technologies to create even more dynamic and compelling web experiences# My-Portfolio
